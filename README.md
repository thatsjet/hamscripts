# Jet's Hamscripts (W4PEW)

Welcome to hamscripts — a cozy little toolbox of scripts, tips, and how-tos for people who like radios, terminals, and having things Just Work™. Whether you’re automating the things, wrangling rigs, or just nerding out, this repo is where my tasty bits neither of us has to reinvent the wheel.

## What this repo is for

- A collection of small, focused scripts for amateur radio ops.
- Short walkthroughs and notes for getting tools running on macOS (and sometimes Linux. Windows users are on their own).
- Practical examples you can copy, tweak, and adopt for your own shack.

Expect things to be informal, well-commented, and approachable — because ham radio should be fun and not a stress test for your patience.

## Current Projects

### Winlink Runner

- A ready-to-run bash helper that starts `rigctld`, launches the **[Pat Winlink web client](https://getpat.io/)**, opens the UI in your browser, and manages shutdown and error handling. It's a small automation that saves a lot of repetitive clicks.

See [`mac_winlink_runner/README.md`](mac_winlink_runner/README.md) for details and installation steps.
